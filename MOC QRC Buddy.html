Follow these critical rules for Summary:
- The entire final summary MUST be in ALL CAPS.
- The summary must be a single paragraph.
- Always end the summary with "ALL APPROPRIATE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED." unless the event is self-contained (like a found tool).
- If the document lists specific agencies, just state "ALL APPROPRIATE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED."
- Do not mention that a checklist was initiated or completed.
- Do not include a list of actions that need to be preformed as it is fluff and not needed. 
- Do not say all call, Instead refre to them as a "Mass Notification"
- If investigations have started or were preformed state that in the summary.
